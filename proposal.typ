*(1.1) What is REITs*

A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate. They package these real estate as mutual funds and put into equity market.

The function of REITs is similar to stock. They pool the capital of numerous investors. This makes it possible for individual investors to earn dividends from real estate investments without having to buy, manage, or finance any properties themselves. Compared with physical real estate investments, REITs is more accessible and liquid.

REITs invest in most real estate property types, including apartment buildings, cell towers, data centers, hotels, medical facilities, offices, retail centers, and warehouses. In other words, REITs is flexible in invest in commercial, public and residential property at period.

In contrast, the physical real estate investments may not achieve this diversification.

===== (2) characterizes of REITs

*(2.1) High dividends*

By law and IRS regulation, REITs must pay out 90% or more of their taxable profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. As a result, REIT companies are often exempt from most corporate income tax.

We should generate a visualized view of that how the dividends from REITs is high.

Approach:

1. Plot the REITs yield rate and average yield in stock (such as DBS Group Holdings Ltd, Singtel and etc.), compare the return from REITs sector to the average return from other sector.
2. Plot the SREITs yields vs other Asset Classes (such as STI and bonds)

*(2.2) Exposure to global real estate*

Over 90% of S-REITS own properties outside Singapore. Which market the REITs suffer most?

Approach:

1. Regress these REITs on three different market (SG, US and global market index), identify the foreigner market contributor of the price of REITs.
1. Tabulate the Correlation Matrix Between SREITs and other assets in different market.

*(3) Long-term investment*

REITs offer a strong, stable annual dividend and the potential for long-term capital appreciation.

Approach:

1. Using the average annual total returns in CSOP iEdge S-REIT Leaders Index ETF to generate the yield curve from 1 year to 5 years.
1. In contrast, plot the yield curve in stock index, bonds of SG market, combined with U.S. stocks and U.S. Market index.
1. Compare the long term return of each financial assets, to analysis the connection of REITs and other equity and identify the long-term advantage of REITs.

*(4) Mitigate economic cycle risk*
Combining assets that exhibit low performance correlation can play an important role in reducing portfolio risk without sacrificing return potential. REITs is a good portfolio diversifier.

Approach:

1. Generate following portfolios:
   - 55% Market index funds + 35% Bonds + 10% REITs
   - 40% Market index funds + 40% Bonds + 20% REITs
   - 33.3% Market index funds + 33.3% Bonds + 33.3% REITs
   - 60% Market index funds + 40% Bonds
   - 80% Market index funds + 20% Bonds
2. Calculate the expected returns, standard deviation of returns and Sharpe ratio on these portfolios.
3. Rank these portfolio under Sharpe ration, and plot the scatter diagram in average return and standard deviation.
4. Compare the average annualized return between the portfolios with REITs and without REITs.
   - Analysis the ability of REITs in diversification of risk.
