# Adjusted Price Calculation

https://support.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=policies:adjusted_data

Let's look at this example. A stock closes at $40.00 on Monday. On Tuesday, it begins trading ex-dividend based on a $2.00 dividend. If the stock opens unchanged, it will be trading at $38.00. Unless we adjust the prior prices, the chart will show a misleading $2.00 gap.

To calculate the adjustment factor, we subtract the $2.00 dividend from Monday's closing price ($40.00 - $2.00 = $38.00). Then, we divide 38.00 by 40.00 to determine the dividend adjustment in percentage terms. The result is 0.95.

Lastly, we _multiply_ all historical prices prior to the dividend by the factor of 0.95. This adjusts historical prices proportionately so that they stay rationally aligned with current prices.

## From Slides

In most cases it is convenient to choose the adjusted closing price (denoted by Close) for empirical work.

To smooth out the effect of the dividend, the closing price and all previous prices are scaled by an appropriate adjustment factor.

Total Adjustment Factor: 0.9854897210090522 * 0.9859243080531075 * 0.9869252438758731 * 0.984798137264699 * 0.9897606945079971 * 0.9891442210895719 * 0.9888489582165476 * 0.9896361931120592 = 0.9047373106352632

Current(2024-04-27) Price: 36.08
Adjusted Price(2022-03-03): 30.075195

Return using normal Adjusted Price:
36.08/30.075195 - 1 = 0.19965971957954043 = 20.0%

But, if we add back the dividend, the original price is: 33.23

The real return is:
(36.08 + 3.32)/33.23 - 1 = 0.18567559434246173 = 18.6%

Difference by:
0.19965971957954043/0.18567559434246173 - 1 = 0.07531482684410462 = 7.53%
