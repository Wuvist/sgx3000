## Abstract

This report presents a thorough quantitative analysis of the Singapore Exchange (SGX), highlighting its unique position within global financial markets and its potential as a fertile ground for diverse investment strategies. Through a detailed examination of the SGX's market characteristics, including its size, liquidity constraints, and the significant role of dividends and REITs, we identify unique opportunities and challenges for investors. Our investigation extends to the formulation and evaluation of two novel investment strategies: the Dividend Add-Back Approach and the Return Chasing Trading Strategy (RCTS), which are rigorously compared using the Diebold-Mariano test over different economic conditions. Additionally, we delve into the impact of dividends on market performance indices and propose a methodological refinement to account for dividends in investment returns, challenging the conventional reliance on adjusted close prices. Our findings not only contribute to the existing body of financial econometric literature by offering new insights into the SGX and its investment prospects but also provide practical guidance for investors seeking to navigate this unique market. The study underscores the importance of considering dividend policies and market capitalization in developing robust investment strategies and offers a compelling case for the inclusion of SGX in diversified investment portfolios.
