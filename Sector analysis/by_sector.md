Based on the updated data, the investment worthiness ranking, considering both the P/E ratio for potential undervaluation and market cap for stability and size, would be:

1. Prudential plc - Lowest P/E ratio among those listed, suggesting potential undervaluation, with a sizable market cap.
2. OCBC - Offers a slightly higher P/E ratio than Prudential but has a larger market cap, indicating significant stability and size within the sector.
3. UOB - With a moderate P/E ratio and a substantial market cap, UOB stands out for its stability and fair valuation.
4. DBS Group Holdings Ltd - While having a slightly higher P/E ratio, its large market cap suggests it's a market leader, providing stability.
5. Great Eastern Holdings - Exhibits a higher P/E ratio but still below 9, combined with a decent market cap, indicating reasonable valuation and stability.
6. HongKong Land Holdings Limited - Due to the lack of a positive P/E ratio (negative EPS), it's ranked lowest for investment based on these criteria, also having the smallest market cap among those listed.
